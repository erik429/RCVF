Why You Coming Fast  is a program to make life easier for Rust server wipes. Instead of manually spamming client.connect to get into wiped server.

🛠️ Features
Automated Connection: Start the program before the wipe, and it will connect automatically when the server restarts.
Queue Dodging: Skip que on Rustoria main force wipe!
First on the beach: Pings the server query multiple times per second (6–25 times) and instantly connects the Rust client as soon as the server is back online.


🚀 How It Works
The program continuously pings the server to check if it's online.
As soon as the server responds, it:
Focus Rust window
Open Console
Paste the server IP and press Enter.

💾 How to use
1. Enter battlemetrics Server URL that you wish to connect to
2. Start and wait :)

🚨 Disclaimer
Q: Could this lead to a ban?
A: Most unlikely. The program operates as a simple bot that uses sendkeys to interact with the Rust client. However, as with any automation tool, use it at your own risk.
