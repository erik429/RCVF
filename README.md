**Why You Coming Fast** is a program to make life easier for Rust server wipes. Instead of manually spamming `client.connect` to get into a wiped server.

## 🛠️ Features

✅ **Automated Connection**: Start the program before the wipe, and it will connect automatically when the server restarts.  
✅ **Dodge the que**: Skip queues on Rustoria main force wipe!  
✅ **First on the beach**: Pings the server query multiple times per second (6–25 times) and instantly connects the Rust client as soon as the server is back online.

## 🚀 How It Works

👁️ The program continuously pings the server to check if it's online.  
🟢 As soon as the server responds, it:  
- 🎯 **Focus Rust window**
- 💻 **Press 'F1' to Open Console**
- 📋 **Paste the server IP and press Enter**

## 💾 How to Use

1. Enter the Battlemetrics Server URL that you wish to connect to.  
2. Start and wait. :)

## 🚨 Disclaimer

**Q: Could this lead to a ban?**  
A: Most unlikely. The program operates as a simple bot that uses `sendkeys` to interact with the Rust client. However, as with any automation tool, use it at your own risk.
